# AVR-Smart-Matrix-Display
A modular firmware development for cascaded 8x8 LED matrices driven by MAX7219 and ATmega328P. This project explores high-speed SPI communication, custom font rendering, and real-time animation logic, progressing from a dynamic Scrolling Text display to a sophisticated English Word Clock.
